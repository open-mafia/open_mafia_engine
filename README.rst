Open Mafia Engine
#################

Open-source, extendable mafia engine, written in Python.

Docs available at https://open-mafia-engine.rtfd.io (stable/master) 
or https://open-mafia-engine.readthedocs.io/en/dev/ (dev).
So far, "stable" just lags behind "dev".

Currently under construction! Feel free to star and check back soonish! :)
