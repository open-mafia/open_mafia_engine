## Developing

This project is developed by the Open Mafia Team.
The primary author is Anatoly "NowanIlfideme" Makarevich.

The main inspiration for this Engine was many years of forum mafia at
the Bay12Games (Dwarf Fortress) forums.

## Projects Using Open Mafia Engine

The [open_mafia_discord_bot](https://github.com/open-mafia/open_mafia_discord_bot)
is a reference implementation of bot functionality for [Discord](https://discord.com/).
Note that the library is currently private, until sufficiently developed.

The [Bay12 Mafia bot](https://github.com/open-mafia/bay12_mafia) is another
project that runs the mafia via forum posts and private messages inside
Bay12Forums (which runs as a Simple Machines Forum).

It is also being developed in private, mostly to avoid potential misuse of its
posting/PM-sending capabilities.
