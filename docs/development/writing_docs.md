# Writing Docs

When writing docs, use the [Di√°taxis Framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
(formerly [The Documentation System](https://documentation.divio.com/)).

This framework splits the docs into four main sections:

1. Tutorials
2. How-to Guides
3. Explanation
4. Reference

This page exists mostly for the developers to keep this in mind. ;)
