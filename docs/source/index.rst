Welcome to Open Mafia Engine's documentation!
=============================================

This Python library, :mod:`mafia`, is currently under 
(semi-)active development. The aim is to create a consistent, 
extendable engine for Mafia/Werewolf-like games.

The Git repository can be found here at:
